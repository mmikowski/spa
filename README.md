# Purpose

These are the resources discussed in the book 
**Single Page Web Applications - JavaScript end-to-end**.

- **Source Code** : The `/listings` directory contains all the source code
from the book, along with a few extras.

- **Quick Reference** : The quick-reference cheat-sheet is a condensation of 
**Appendix A - Code standards**.

- **jQuery Plugins** : If you are looking jQuery plugins, a quick list can be found
[on the plugin site](http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=mikowskihttp://plugins.jquery.com/?s=mikowski).

### Standards

I hope to post the full standards here in the near future so that
they may be continually updated by the community.
This is pending approval by Manning and my co-author.
